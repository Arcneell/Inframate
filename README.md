# NetOps Flow

> **Note**: This project was entirely generated by AI (Claude by Anthropic).

A self-hosted NetDevOps platform for network operations management, featuring IP Address Management (IPAM) and script automation capabilities.

## Features

### IPAM (IP Address Management)
- Create and manage subnets with CIDR validation
- Allocate and track IP addresses within subnets
- Automatic subnet scanning using nmap to discover active hosts
- Track IP address status (active/available), hostname, and MAC address

### Script Runner
- Upload and manage Python (`.py`) and Bash (`.sh`) scripts
- Execute scripts locally on the server or remotely via SSH/WinRM
- Support for script arguments
- Real-time capture of stdout/stderr logs
- Execution status tracking (pending, running, success, failure, cancelled)
- Ability to stop running executions

### Network Topology
- Visual network topology display showing subnets and IP addresses
- Color-coded visualization (green for active IPs, gray for available)

### Dashboard
- Statistics overview: total subnets, active IPs, scripts, and executions
- System status monitoring
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### User Management
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Granular permissions (IPAM, Topology, Scripts, Settings)
- Admin can create and delete users
- Password validation (minimum 8 characters)

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with configurable secret
- CORS protection with configurable origins
- Rate limiting on login endpoint
- Path traversal protection for file uploads
- Input validation and sanitization

### Internationalization
- Full support for English and French
- Language preference persisted across sessions

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
